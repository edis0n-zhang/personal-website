Hi I'm Edison, I'm currently studying computer science at UCSB. I made [this website](Personal%20Website.md) as a tool to help me share and document my writing. Feel free to browse my page using the explorer, here's a [map](Navigation%20Guide.md) for my website to help you with your journey. 

Currently I'm deeply interested in deep learning and web development.

Some pages you may be interested in:
- [[Resume]]: Elaborating on my experiences and projects beyond what can fit in a traditional resume and providing additional context.
- [[Course Catalogue]]: An online public resource containing notes and resources from classes I have taken. Partly created for myself as a way to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).
