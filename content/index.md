Hi I'm Edison, I'm currently studying computer science at UCSB. I made this [website](Personal%20Website.md) as a tool to help me share and document my writing. Feel free to read more about my [[/projects]], [[/experiences]], [[/thoughts]], [[/notes]], or just browse.

Here's a [guide](Navigation%20Guide) on how to navigate my page, I hope you enjoy your stay!
