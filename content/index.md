Hi I'm Edison, I'm currently studying computer science at UCSB currently interested in machine learning. I made [this website](Personal%20Website.md) as a tool to help me share and document my writing. Feel free to browse my page using the explorer, here's a [map](Navigation%20Guide.md) for my website to help you with your journey. 

Currently I'm deeply interested in deep learning and web development.

Some pages you may be interested in:
- [[Resume]]: Elaborating on my experiences and projects beyond what can fit in a traditional resume and providing additional context.
- [[Course Catalogue]]: An online public resource containing the lecture notes from classes I have taken. Partly created for myself as a way to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). 
- [[My Webdesk]]: A public history of the digital tools I've tried and am currently using. I find myself constantly changing and trying different tools for all of my digital needs and thought it would be fun to have log of my journey.

If you need to contact me feel free to connect with me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edison--zhang/)!
