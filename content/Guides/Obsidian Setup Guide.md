# Preface

If you're here I likely convinced you to use Obsidian or you asked me "what's that app you're always on?" and I sent you here. Hopefully this guide will help you get started, you won't regret picking it up!

# What is Obsidian?

Obsidian at its core is a markdown editor. Yup, all it does is edit markdown files. That's it, it just does that one thing really well. This is intentional, Obsidian is designed with the understanding that the files will outlast the tool.

> The ancient temples of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.
> *-- Steph Ango, CEO Of Obsidian*

One day Obsidian **will** become defunct. When this happens your files will still exist, they are plain files stored locally that anyone can access and open. I would like to pose you question, what would happen to your files if a service like Google Docs or Notion disappears? 
# Setup
Download and install Obsidian [here](https://obsidian.md/). 

## Organization
One of Obsidian's biggest selling points is its organizational capability. You can easily create links between your notes using the following syntax `[[linktofile]]` . 

**TO FINISH Daily notes, To Do Lists, Graphs**

## Themes
Themes are community made themes (duh) that help you tune the appearance of your Obsidian to your liking. These can be further tuned with the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin or your own css.

**Some of my favorites:** \
[Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) \
[Nord](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_nord) \
[Prism](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Prism-Theme) 
## Plugins
Plugins are community made extensions that can add additional functionality not included in base Obsidian. 

Install and manage plugins using the community plugins section in your Obsidian options.

**Here are some plugins I personally find useful:** \
[Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count): Adds more word count statistics, i.e hover to find word count of highlighted. \
[Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin): Adds a calendar you can use to organize your daily notes. \
[Execute Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59815504/how-to-run-a-github-repository): Adds the ability to run code inside markdown code blocks, useful for notes. **note:** to add a C++ execute code block use 'run-cpp'. \
[Markdown Table Editor](https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-table-editor): Adds GUI to create and edit markdown tables. \
[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings): Adds the ability to easily modify your theme.
