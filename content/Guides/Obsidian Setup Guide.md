# Preface

If you're here I likely convinced you to use Obsidian or you asked me "what's that app you're always on?" and I sent you here. Hopefully this guide will help you get started, you won't regret picking it up!

# What is Obsidian?

Obsidian at its core is a markdown editor. Yup, all it does is edit markdown files. That's it, it just does that one thing really well. This is intentional, Obsidian is designed with the understanding that the files will outlast the tool.

> The ancient temples of Egypt contain hieroglyphs that were chiseled in stone thousands of years ago. The ideas hieroglyphs convey are more important than the type of chisel that was used to carve them.
> *-- Steph Ango, CEO Of Obsidian*

One day Obsidian **will** become defunct. When this happens your files will still exist, they are plain files stored locally that anyone can access and open. I would like to pose you question, what would happen to your files if a service like Google Docs or Notion disappears?
# Setup
Download and install Obsidian [here](https://obsidian.md/). 

## Organization
One of Obsidian's biggest selling points is its organizational capability. 

**Here are some of the features you may want to utilize:**
- **Links**: Obsidian allows you to create links between your notes, helping you connect ideas.
	 - You can create links using the following syntax `[[linktofile]]` . 
	 - Some applications include the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).
	- These links can be kept track of using Obsidian's graph feature. It's very pretty!
	- Every note also has backlinks, helping you know what it helps define.
- **Daily Notes**: Obsidian allows the creation of daily notes, this is useful for keeping track of daily tasks or just writing down miscellaneous things that you do during the day. 
	- I highly recommend using the [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin) plugin to keep track  of your daily notes.
- **Folders**: Just like any other file management system, it's a great idea to use folders to organize your ideas together.
- **[Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)**: A plugin that allows query your notes like a relational database by their properties you set in the frontmatter. More in the plugins section.
- Tags: You can tag and search your notes by tag.
	- Use the syntax `#tag`

In the end, I highly recommend experimenting with different organizational formats until you figure out what's best for **YOU**. You don't (and shouldn't) have to make use of every fancy feature just because someone online tells you to, often you may find you don't need the extra fluff. Remember that your organizational system should work **for** you, not **against**. 

What is important is you are aware of the tools that are available and that Obsidian provides the features and flexibility needed for your workflow.
## Themes
Themes are community made themes (duh) that help you tune the appearance of your Obsidian to your liking. These can be further tuned with the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin or your own css.

**Some of my favorites:** \
[Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) \
[Nord](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_nord) \
[Prism](https://github.com/damiankorcz/Prism-Theme) 
## Plugins
Plugins are community made extensions that can add additional functionality not included in base Obsidian. 

Install and manage plugins using the community plugins section in your Obsidian options.

**Here are some plugins I personally find useful:** \
[Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count): Adds more word count statistics, i.e hover to find word count of highlighted. \
[Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin): Adds a calendar you can use to organize your daily notes. \
[Execute Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59815504/how-to-run-a-github-repository): Adds the ability to run code inside markdown code blocks, useful for notes. **note:** to add a C++ execute code block use 'run-cpp'. \
[Markdown Table Editor](https://github.com/ganesshkumar/obsidian-table-editor): Adds GUI to create and edit markdown tables. \
[Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings): Adds the ability to easily modify your theme.
