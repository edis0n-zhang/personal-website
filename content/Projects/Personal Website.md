Every since I was a kid, I've always wanted to build my own website. Carve out a little corner of the internet for myself, mold and build it in my own image. I think my first attempt at this was when I was 8, playing around with Google Sites, fumbling around with basic html and creating a "Daily DBZ Trivia" website. I updated it once and it contained a total of two facts before I got distracted with whatever 8 year old me was enamoured with at the time. The beginning of the many projects I would start but not finish... hopefully this website won't lay beside "Daily DBZ Trivia" in the idea graveyard. (I wonder if I could still find it somewhere?)

As I grew older, this desire never left me. Even as I learned more about computer science, I was held myself back from actually getting started. I would always rationalize it by saying I didn't have the skills, didn't have time, or wouldn't be able to execute it to the degree that I wanted. Perhaps I was held back by my fear of failure.
