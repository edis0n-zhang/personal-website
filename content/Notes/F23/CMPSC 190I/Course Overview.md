- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ucsb/fall2023/cmpsc190i)
## Prerequisites

- Linear Algebra
	- Vector, matrix, norm, rank, linearly independent
- Vector Calculus
	- Chain Rule, Calculate Gradients for Multiple Variables
- Probability
	- Bayes Rule, Maximum Likelihood
- Coding
	- Python
- Basic Concepts of Machine Learning
	- Classification vs. Regression, Supervised learning vs. Unsupervised learning

Having taken CS 165 A/B before not required

## Tools
- Google Colab
	- Ipython notebook
	- Can access GPU run-time
	- Support both coding and text editing
- LaTex
	- Very useful for scientific wwriting
	- [LaTex + Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bebi103a/bebi103a.github.io/blob/master/lessons/00/intro_to_latex.ipynb)

## Grading

- Homework (60%)
	- Including the self-assessment
	- No handwritten homework: Colab notebook
	- No late homework
- Midterm (20%)
	- November
	- In-class / evening exam
	- Open book but no internet
	- No makeup exam
- Final (20%)
	- Format undecided
	- Exam? Large Coding Project? Coding test within 3-hour test time?

## Topics

- Linear models
	- Regression
	- Classification, both binary and multi-class settings
- Multi-layer perceptron / Fully connected neural networks
- Gradient descent, back-propagation, optimizers
- Training recipe for deep models
	- Overfitting, data augmentation, activation function, normalization, etc.
- CNN, ResNet, RNN, Transformer Architectures

### Class Format
- In-class lecture (by instructor)
	- Concepts behind the topic
	- Mathematical derivation
	- Examples
- In-class implementation (by instructor + TAs)
	- Implement together in class
	- Make sure you understand the concept and avoid common mistakes
	- Laptops are needed
- Homework
	- Extension based on the already-implemented code in class
- Discussion session (by TAs)
	- Extended Topics
	- e.g you learned GD / SGD in class, you will learn Adam in these sessions
